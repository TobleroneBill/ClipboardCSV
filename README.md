# ClipboardCSV
Copy text to CSV for windows
Really basic thing I am using to copy a bunch of ChatGPT data, thinking now, there is probably some API thing but last time it cost legit money so I don't wanna use that

### CONTROLS:
-  CTRL+C - copy text to CSV
-  ESC - quit

### HOW IT WORKS:
CTRL+C to copy text. This automatically gets sent to the CSV file, and stores the line number its saved at.

The CMD prompt shows what has been copied, and the line it is saved on.
uses playsound to play factorio noises (reallu satisfying) as an audio Que.

Very light on features, because this is for games jam, but might make tkinter interface for it in the future

python kinda sucks for legitimate app development I think personally, so I doubt I would continue with python.
I could also use some sort of wierd language combo to combine this basic existing code, inside of a C# GUI which actually sounds cool now I think about it, or react native.
